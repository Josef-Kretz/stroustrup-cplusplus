Never needed any reason
To find deliverance
Like a cancer running through my veins, oh
It's never going to give in...

See them march like lambs to the slaughter
Toy soldiers line up on the alter
I was never meant to drink that water
They'll remember me, when I'm underground...

Heavy is the crown
Never pause, never let them bleed you out
Are they still standing when they try to bring the castle down
I'll never bow down
Heavy is the crown

Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown

When the weight of the world crashing
Pushing you closer to the edge (Closer to the edge...)
You find a way to get a little bit stronger
To fight all off the demons, yeah...

See them march like lambs to the slaughter
Toy soldiers line up on the alter
I'll rise, hell or high water
You'll remember me, when I'm underground

Heavy is the crown
Never pause, never let them bleed you out
Are they still standing when they try to bring the castle down
I'll never bow down
Heavy is the crown

(Everything will fade away)
Everything will fade away
Well, the love that's in this world is meant to stay

Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown

Heavy is the crown
Never pause, never let them bleed you out
Are they still standing when they try to bring the castle down
And I'll never bow down
Heavy is the crown

Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown, heavy is the crown, oh
Heavy is the crown...

My life's been magic seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
It's funny when you want it
Suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold's just plastic

Every day every night
I've been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night

I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me, I'm never coming down

I worked my whole life
Just to get high just to realize
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground

Nah but they don't hear me though
(Yeah what goes up it must come down)
Nah but they don't hear me though
(You're running out of time)

My world's been hectic seems electric
But I've been waking up with your voice in my head
And I'm trying to send a message
And let you know that every single minute
I'm without you, I regret it

Every day every night
I've been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night

I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me, I'm never coming down
I worked my whole life
Just to get high just to realize
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground

Nah but they don't hear me though
(Yeah what goes up it must come down)
Nah but they don't hear me though
(You're running out of time)

I'm way up in the clouds
And they say I've made it now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the ground

Just drove by your house
So far from you now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground
Nah but they don't hear me though

On the ground
Nah but they don't hear me though
Everything I need is on the ground

Marcus fucking Hopson, my guy, what up?
Don't mean to intervene
How are things going?
Talk to me, how you livin' G?
You look so confused right now
Do you remember me?
'Cause I've been with you since a teen, fuckin' you up mentally
I love it (I do) stayin' inside your head, where the rent is free
I'm just here to make sure you keep all your crazy tendencies
Look at yourself in disbelief, struggle with your identity
Stuck in depression until you diagnosed with it clinically
How's your love life? It's still a trifling mess?
Nigga you thirty-five, you haven't found a wifey yet?
I mean, if I was you would I be stressed? Y-E-S
I guess a mail-order bride is nice, it might be best
So how did you managed to get rich, yet be so empty?
Constantly stuck in deep old frenzy
Maybe your ego and echo friendly
Bro you got a life that we don't envy
And I bet suicide must be so tempting, do it

Wait, hold up (Damn)
Fucks wrong with me?
I can't leave me alone with me
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Wait, hold up (Shit)
Stop controlling me
I don't know who I'm supposed to be
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror

So how's the rap life?
Do people enjoy your music?
Or you still spitting that bullshit to destroy the youth with?
Be honest, you live in the shadow of Joyner Lucas (Oh-oh)
Jealous? I know that you are, my point is proven
Fuck happened to you?
You was spittin' so cold, you was the Ill Mind of Hopsin on the list with the GOATs
Then you fell off, you should've took a different approach
I hate to say it, but you'll never be like Kendrick or Cole, nigga
It's fucked up, that isn't fair Marcus
I'm hoping that God will answer your prayers Marcus
But even if he does the chances are rare that you'll have hands in the air headlining Madison Square Garden
Nigga put the mic' down don't you fight this fight
'Cause you the corny rapper only weird white kids like
So every time the blogs post you, the comments gon' roast you
I would rather be dead than be caught livin' in your shoes

Wait, hold up (I'm tripping)
Fucks wrong with me?
I can't leave me alone with me
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Wait, hold up (Please stop)
Stop controlling me
I don't know who I'm supposed to be
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror

Aight, I got an idea, I'll tell you how it works
It's gonna sound a little outrageous, but hear me out first
You turn your phone off for two weeks
And start an outburst of worried family members, which leads to a local town search
But when they find you, you're dead inside your crib
With a letter that says goodbye to your kid
But you don't get to see him anyway 'cause your ex is wildin' and shit
So in his little head it's like you already died, it's a trip
While you reside in Heaven or Hell, which ever side that it is
You baby mom's a regret, that shit you never tried to get fixed
If you're alive, chances are she'll never try to repent
I'm just tryna show you ways to exercise your revenge
All you want is love, right?
Well, you gon' have to get some balls
Shoot your fuckin' brains out until they splat against the walls
I mean it has to hit the blogs and all your fans will get evolved
And you'll be missed, 'cause people don't know what they have until it's lost
Hug your dad and kiss your mom before this transition is done into the new life
Your current one is trash, it isn't fun
Yeah everybody got problems and we all fightin' this big war
But your problems are different, you got nothin' to live for

Wait, hold up (Oh no)
Fucks wrong with me?
I can't leave me alone with me
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Wait, hold up (Please stop)
Stop controlling me
I don't know who I'm supposed to be
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror

What I'm thinking, what you're thinking is not the important thing
We are alive right now, that is the important thing
It is important that you focus on this fundamental sense of aliveness within you
And then you will see there's a natural distance between you and your thought process
Once you create a little space between you and your mind, between you and your body - this is the end of suffering
Don't identify any thought as negative because it's just a thought
Who told you it's negative?
It's just a thought, you are making it up, maybe you like it
What's the problem?
If you understand it's just a thought, it has no power
If you think it's a reality, then it destroys you
